## Hello! Bonjour! こんにちは! 안녕하세요!

I'm Danny, a full-stack developer, web designer, and coordinator in many communities. I have skills in JavaScript (Node, Deno, Electron, and client-side) and Python. I'm also slowly learning Java, TypeScript, C#, Rust, and Go too!

I am a Head/Lead Developer at [Ice Cream Studios](https://discord.gg/XUPHpTrZdP). We develop the namesake bot Ice Cream.

I'm an Owner at [Cozy](https://docs.cozy.lol), a Minecraft network primarily focused on SMP and Creative game modes. I'm also lead systems administrator at Cozy, in addition to co-lead of Systems Disaster Response & Recovery.

***My website has all my social medias and links. It can be found [here](https://bean.codes).***
