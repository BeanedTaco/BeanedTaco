## Hello! Bonjour! こんにちは! 안녕하세요!

I'm Danny, a full-stack developer, web designer, and coordinator in many communities. I have skills in JavaScript (Node, Deno, Electron, and client-side) and Python. I'm also slowly learning Java, TypeScript, C#, Rust, and Go too!

I am a Head/Lead Developer at [Lights On Studios](https://lightson.xyz). We create cool Discord bots and programmes at Lights On, and we maintain Ice Cream (our flagship Discord bot).

I also work for [Squared Labs](https://discord.gg/BbRn5AtkvG) as a Senior Developer. We create software for the public and conduct cool experiments.

I currently lead DevOps [at Artemis](https://artemis.org.uk) as an Owner/Lead Developer. I left Artemis for some time, but I have returned to my original position.

***My website has all my social medias and links. It can be found [here](https://bean.codes).***
