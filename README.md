## Hello! Bonjour! こんにちは! 안녕하세요!

I'm Danny, a full-stack developer, web designer, and coordinator in many communities. I have skills in JavaScript (Node, Electron, and client-side) and Python. I'm also slowly learning Java as well!

I currently work for [Squared Labs](https://discord.gg/BbRn5AtkvG) as a Senior Developer. We create software for the public and conduct cool experiments.

I used to work for [Artemis Studios](https://artemisdev.tech) as a Lead Developer, and I was working on the [Kiwi](https://artemisdev.tech/kiwi) project. It's a multi-purpose Discord bot.

***My website has all my social medias and links. It can be found [here](https://bean.codes).***
