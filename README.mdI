## Hello! Bonjour! こんにちは! 안녕하세요!

I'm Danny, a "full-stack" developer, web designer, and coordinator at many communities. I have skills in JavaScript (Node, Electron, and client-side) and Python. I'm also slowly learning Java and C as well!

I work for [Artemis Studios](https://artemisdev.tech) as a Lead Developer. I currently am working on the [Kiwi](https://artemisdev.tech/kiwi) project. It's a multi-purpose Discord bot.

***My website has all my social medias and links. It can be found [here](https://bean.codes).***
